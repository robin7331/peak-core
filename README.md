# PEAK
PEAK is a framework for embedding UI and non UI related web technologies into a native iOS and/or Android mobile app. PEAK manages all the heavy lifting in terms of bidirectional communication between a JS context and your mobile code. 

# PEAK Core
This core module represents the JS to navive bridge of the entire framework. It also features a shared in memory and persistant value store which is accessable from both sides of your application.


PEAK Core is running in a JS context and is meant to be used alongside with one of the native PEAK iOS or Android libraries.

If you want to add userland functionalities please refere to the PEAK module development guide.
