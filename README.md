# Overview
Peak is a framework for embedding UI and non UI related web technologies into a native iOS and/or Android mobile app. Peak manages all the heavy lifting in terms of bidirectional communication between a JS context and your mobile code. 

# Peak Core
This core module represents the JS to navive bridge of the entire framework. It also features a shared in memory and persistant value store which is accessable from both sides of your application.

Peak Core is running in a JS context and is meant to be used alongside with one of the native Peak iOS or Android libraries.

# Modules

Peak uses modules to add functionality to the system.
Please refere to the modules development guide for more informations.

*When developing a PEAK application you usually don't have to touch or interact with this library as such.*
